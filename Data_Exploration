Analysis:
Genderqueer individuals have the highest rates of several mental health disorders, especially mood disorders and anxiety-related conditions.


People who chose not to disclose their gender identity also show consistently high prevalence across most mental health categories.


Females (based on gender identity) tend to have higher rates of mental health issues compared to males, particularly in mood and stress-related disorders.


Disorders like personality disorders, substance-related disorders, and behavioral syndromes are also more common in non-binary and undisclosed groups than in traditional male/female identities.


Overall, the data suggests that non-binary, gender-diverse, and undisclosed groups experience a disproportionately higher burden of mental health issues, which may point to underlying social, cultural, or systemic stressors.

Analysis:
Proportion= Total number of people in that groupNumber of people with ≥1 mental health diagnosis​
Females assigned at birth have a higher proportion of reported mental health issues than males.


Those who chose not to disclose their sex or were marked as "Uncertain" also show high prevalence, possibly due to underlying social or identity stressors.

Code:
# Group by GenderIdentity
gender_summary = df.groupby('GenderIdentity')['Any_Mental_Health_Issue'].mean().reset_index()

# Focus on the top 6 most common identities
top_genders = df['GenderIdentity'].value_counts().nlargest(6).index.tolist()

plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

Analysis: 
Proportion= Total number of people in that groupNumber of people with ≥1 mental health diagnosis​

Genderqueer individuals have the highest prevalence of mental health issues among all identity groups.


People who chose not to disclose their gender identity also show significantly elevated rates.


Females again have higher rates than males, while males report the lowest among the top six identities.

Analysis:
0 = 0% of people in that group have any diagnosed mental health issue.


0.5 = 50% of people in that group have at least one diagnosed mental health issue.


1 = 100% of people in that group have a mental health issue (this would be rare).

 1. Housing, Food, and Transportation Needs
People experiencing housing instability, food insecurity, or transportation challenges have significantly higher rates of mental health issues.


In some groups, over 50% reported a mental health condition — a clear signal that basic needs are deeply tied to mental well-being.


 2. Lack of Social Connections
Individuals reporting no or weak social connections show a notably higher mental health burden.


This supports the idea that social isolation is a major mental health risk factor.



 3. Gender Identity
Gender-diverse groups — such as nonbinary, transgender, and "other" — consistently show higher proportions of mental health issues than binary identities (male/female).


This points to the impact of identity-related stress, stigma, or lack of support.



 4. Sexual Orientation
People identifying as gay, lesbian, bisexual, or queer also show elevated rates compared to heterosexual individuals.


Again, this may reflect minority stress and lack of affirming resources.
 Overall Takeaway:
The data supports what many clinicians already observe — that mental health is strongly shaped by unmet social needs and identity-based challenges.


These insights can help justify investments in preventative care, community support, and mental health resources, even when they don’t immediately drive revenue.
